= OpenSCAD Polyominos

This OpenSCAD library can generate polyomino (pentomino etc) tiles for board games, and a gridded board on which to place them.

Type `make` to (re)generate the STL files.

== Printing suggestions

=== Boards

Set the top infill to Octogram Spiral or Concentric, except for the highest layer which can remain as rectilinear/monotonic.

=== Pieces

I used SuperSlicer, with the output option "Complete individual objects".  This gives one skirt around each object, unlike PrusaSlicer, which only draws a single all-objects skirt.

I set the printer "Between objects G-code (for sequential printing)" to `M600`, to give a filament change.

For the pentominos, which have holes, I set height range modifiers (6-7mm) with a "Bridging angle" of 135Â°, otherwise the angle varies.

=== Dice

60% infill produced a reasonable weight.
